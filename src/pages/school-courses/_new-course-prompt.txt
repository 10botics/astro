Create the website in astro file under src/pages/school-courses/ and the name of the file should be "course name in traditional chinese.astro"

**CRITICAL URL REQUIREMENTS:**
- The filename MUST be in traditional Chinese 
- The URL slug MUST be in English 
- Add the Chinese filename to English slug mapping in both:
  - `src/pages/school-courses/index.astro` (in the slugMapping object)
  - `src/pages/school-courses/[slug].astro` (in the slugMapping object)
- This ensures the course is accessible via English URLs while maintaining Chinese filenames

**CRITICAL CONTENT ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENT:**
- ALL text content must be defined as objects at the top of the file
- Create separate objects for each section's content
- Use descriptive object names like `heroContent`, `techContent`, `requirementsContent`, etc.
- Reference these objects in the JSX/HTML sections
- This makes content maintenance and updates much easier

**CRITICAL COURSE CURRICULUM SEPARATION REQUIREMENT:**
- When a course has more than one levels, ALWAYS create separate curriculum arrays

Structure the page with these sections in order:
1. Hero section with title, subtitle, tags, and breadcrumbs
2. Hero description section
3. Course requirements section (separate section with heading)
4. Course highlights section
5. Course content/curriculum section (ONLY ONE "課程內容" heading with duration info and accordion)
6. FAQ section (MUST use QnASection component)
7. Contact section

**CRITICAL QnA COMPONENT REQUIREMENT:**
- ALL new course pages MUST use the QnASection component for FAQ sections
- Import the component: `import QnASection from '../../components/course/QnASection.astro';`
- Create a faqItems array with question/answer pairs
- Use the component: `<QnASection faqs={faqItems} />`
- Choose appropriate variant: 'accordion', 'details', or 'simple'
- NEVER create custom FAQ sections - always use the standardized QnASection component

For the course requirements section, create a separate section with:
- Proper heading "課程資訊" or "課程要求"
- Duration, equipment needed, and student requirements
- Use icons and proper styling
- Make it a full-width section, not part of the description column



For the "Course content/curriculum" section:
- Use ONLY ONE heading "課程內容" 
- Include duration information (e.g., "共 X 小時") and adjustment note
- Follow immediately with the accordion section for curriculum details
- DO NOT create separate sections for course content - combine everything under one "課程內容" heading
- IMPORTANT: When using the AccordionSection component, either pass an empty title or create a custom accordion section to avoid duplicate headings like "課程大綱" appearing after "課程內容"
- CRITICAL SPACING: The accordion content should follow immediately after the duration info with minimal spacing (use `mb-8` for duration info, not `mb-12` or separate sections)
- The entire course content section should be ONE unified section, not split into separate sections

**Layout Constraints:**
- Use container classes with maximum width limits:
  - Main content sections: `max-w-6xl` (1152px maximum)
  - Course content accordions: `max-w-4xl` (896px maximum)
  - Contact forms: `max-w-2xl` (672px maximum)
- Always center content with `mx-auto` class
- Use responsive padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Grid layouts should be responsive: `grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Text content should not exceed readable line lengths (avoid very wide text blocks)

**ICON REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL:**
- When creating course pages that use FontAwesome icons, ALWAYS include the FontAwesome CDN link:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css">
    ```
  - Add this line immediately after the `<Layout>` component opening tag
- Use ONLY simple, proven SVG icons that work reliably
- For checkmarks: use the simple checkmark SVG path
- For all other icons: use basic, widely-supported SVG paths
- NEVER use complex or experimental SVG paths
- Test all icons to ensure they render properly

**STYLE CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Follow structure of other existing pages like 人工智能遊戲編程課程.astro, CoSpaces 虛擬實境課程.astro
- Use same components, colors, spacing, and typography
- Match grid layouts, card styling, and responsive design
- Use identical container widths and padding

**COMPONENT USAGE:**
- Use `HeroSection` component for hero section
- Follow same frontmatter structure with `courseData` export
- Use identical data structures for all sections
- Match exact section ordering and naming
