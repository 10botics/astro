Create the website in astro file under src/pages/school-courses/
Use the image component in astro

Structure the page with these sections in order:
1. Hero section with title, subtitle, tags, and breadcrumbs
2. Hero image and description section (2-column layout)
3. Course requirements section (separate section with heading)
4. Course highlights section
5. Course content/curriculum section
6. FAQ section
7. Contact section

For the course requirements section, create a separate section with:
- Proper heading "課程資訊" or "課程要求"
- Duration, equipment needed, and student requirements
- Use icons and proper styling
- Make it a full-width section, not part of the description column
