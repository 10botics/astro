Create the website in astro file under src/pages/school-courses/ and the name of the file should be "course name in traditional chinese.astro"
Use the image component in astro

Structure the page with these sections in order:
1. Hero section with title, subtitle, tags, and breadcrumbs
2. Hero image and description section (2-column layout)
3. Why the technology is important section (explain the significance of the technologies/tools used in the course, e.g., Poe, Repl.it, etc.)
4. Course requirements section (separate section with heading)
5. Course highlights section
6. Course content/curriculum section (ONLY ONE "課程內容" heading with duration info and accordion)
7. FAQ section
8. Contact section

For the course requirements section, create a separate section with:
- Proper heading "課程資訊" or "課程要求"
- Duration, equipment needed, and student requirements
- Use icons and proper styling
- Make it a full-width section, not part of the description column

For the "Why the technology is important" section:
- Add a clear heading, e.g., "為什麼選用這些技術？" or "技術重要性"
- Briefly explain the significance and benefits of the main technologies/tools used in the course (e.g., Poe, Repl.it)
- Use icons or visuals if possible
- Make it a separate, full-width section

For the "Course content/curriculum" section:
- Use ONLY ONE heading "課程內容" 
- Include duration information (e.g., "共 X 小時") and adjustment note
- Follow immediately with the accordion section for curriculum details
- DO NOT create separate sections for course content - combine everything under one "課程內容" heading
- IMPORTANT: When using the AccordionSection component, either pass an empty title or create a custom accordion section to avoid duplicate headings like "課程大綱" appearing after "課程內容"
- CRITICAL SPACING: The accordion content should follow immediately after the duration info with minimal spacing (use `mb-8` for duration info, not `mb-12` or separate sections)
- The entire course content section should be ONE unified section, not split into separate sections

**Layout Constraints:**
- Use container classes with maximum width limits:
  - Main content sections: `max-w-6xl` (1152px maximum)
  - Course content accordions: `max-w-4xl` (896px maximum)
  - Contact forms: `max-w-2xl` (672px maximum)
- Always center content with `mx-auto` class
- Use responsive padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Grid layouts should be responsive: `grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Text content should not exceed readable line lengths (avoid very wide text blocks)
- Images should be constrained with `max-w-lg` or `max-w-xl` for larger images
- Student work galleries should use `max-w-6xl` container with responsive grid

**CRITICAL IMAGE HANDLING REQUIREMENTS:**
- ALWAYS use Astro's `<Image>` component from 'astro:assets' for ALL images
- NEVER use regular HTML `<img>` tags
- Import the Image component at the top: `import { Image } from 'astro:assets';`
- Always provide width and height attributes to the Image component
- For external URLs, use the Image component with the src attribute directly
- Example: `<Image src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Description" width={640} height={480} class="..." />`
- For local images, import them first: `import myImage from '../../assets/images/my-image.jpg';`
- Then use: `<Image src={myImage} alt="Description" class="..." />`
- This is MANDATORY - never use `<img>` tags in Astro components

**ICON REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL:**
- When creating course pages that use FontAwesome icons, ALWAYS include the FontAwesome CDN link:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css">
    ```
  - Add this line immediately after the `<Layout>` component opening tag
- Use ONLY simple, proven SVG icons that work reliably
- For checkmarks: use the simple checkmark SVG path
- For all other icons: use basic, widely-supported SVG paths
- NEVER use complex or experimental SVG paths
- Test all icons to ensure they render properly
