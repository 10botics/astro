I want to migrate a complete school course page from my existing website. Please:

1. **Fetch the complete page content** from [URL] using the PowerShell command
2. **Extract ALL information** including:
   - Exact page title and subtitle
   - Complete course description and detailed content
   - All course sections and subsections
   - Exact curriculum content (beginner and advanced)
   - All course features and highlights
   - Complete FAQ items
   - All images (png, jpg, gif) and their descriptions
   - Any videos or embedded content (if there are any)
   - Contact information and forms
   - Course arrangements and pricing (if there are any)
   - Student work examples (if there are any)

3. **Download ALL images** from the original page and place them in src/assets/images/school-courses/[course name]
4. **Create the exact page structure** matching the original layout
5. **Use only the components available** in src/components/homepage and src/components/course
6. **Preserve exact wording** from the original website
7. **Maintain the exact URL structure** (/school-courses/[course-name])
8. **DO NOT EXAMINE EXISTING COURSE PAGES TO UNDERSTAND PAGE STRUCTURE**

Please extract and migrate EVERY piece of information from the original page without any loss.
