Use astro-csv to process the CSV data. Do NOT manually convert the data - use the proper astro-csv tool/package to parse and integrate the CSV file directly into the page. By including "import {parse} from 'astro-csv' by putting the csv in src/data

Using Astro Content Collections with a Custom Parser:
Astro's Content Collections are designed for managing data. You can configure a collection to read CSV files by providing a custom parser.

Parsing the CSV: You'll typically use a Node.js CSV parsing library, such as csv-parse, to read the CSV file's content and convert it into a structured JavaScript array of objects.
Example Configuration (src/content/config.ts):
typescript

複製
// src/content/config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { file } from 'astro/loaders';
import { parse as parseCsv } from 'csv-parse/sync'; // You'll need to install csv-parse/sync

const products = defineCollection({
  type: 'data', // Or 'content' if you want markdown-like features
  loader: file('src/data/products.csv', {
    parser: (text) => parseCsv(text, { columns: true, skipEmptyLines: true }),
  }),
});

export const collections = { products };
This setup allows Astro to treat your products.csv file (e.g., located at src/data/products.csv) as a data collection [1][2]. The parser function reads the CSV text and converts each row into an object, with column headers as keys.
Displaying in an Astro Component: Once parsed, you can query this data in your Astro pages or components and iterate over it to generate an HTML table.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <!-- Assuming your CSV has 'name', 'price', 'description' columns -->
      <th>Product Name</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {products.map((product) => (
      <tr>
        <td>{product.data.name}</td>
        <td>{product.data.price}</td>
        <td>{product.data.description}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
Using the astro-csv Integration:
There's a community-maintained integration called astro-csv that simplifies using CSV files as data sources in Astro projects [3]. This integration aims to provide a more streamlined way to work with CSVs without manually setting up the parser in content/config.ts. You would typically install it and configure it in your astro.config.mjs file, then use its provided utilities to access your CSV data.

## Notes
- The `popularity` field will automatically contain the star rating
- Empty stars use `☆` character
- Full stars use `★` character
- All Chinese text and URLs will be preserved as-is
- The system handles both single dates and date ranges
- Keywords can contain commas and special characters
