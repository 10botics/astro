When editing content for a Traditional Chinese website, optimize for SEO by following these rules:

Write a title of EXACTLY 8-12 Traditional Chinese characters with clear keywords.

Write a meta description of EXACTLY 50–80 Traditional Chinese characters (≤1000 px) with clear keywords. 
**CRITICAL: Count each Traditional Chinese character individually. Do not exceed 80 characters.**

Ensure at least 600–800 Traditional Chinese characters of useful content.

Keep sentences short and natural; do not artificially extend them.

Balance the number of headings with the amount of text (not too many for thin content).

Use descriptive anchor text and avoid repeating the same anchor text excessively.

Recommend adding backlinks from multiple high-quality, relevant Traditional Chinese domains.

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Before submitting, count Traditional Chinese characters in meta description
- If count exceeds 80, reduce content until within limit
- Always verify character count matches requirement

Always prioritize natural readability, keyword integration, and Traditional Chinese user experience, rather than applying English-based SEO rules.
